proc_schedule.py
----------------
python proc_schedule.py view
 - shows a pretty table of upcoming events

proc_schedule.py add
 - add an event

proc_schedule.py ical
 - update the ical feed
 - might want to call this after manual editing or running add

In general add is just for convenience; if you need to edit you should
open it up in a text editor

makerss.py
----------
This was named when all it did was make an rss feed.  Now it also
builds a large number of static html pages.

python makerss.py
 - updates rss feed
 - updates public_html/news/

comment_requester_wsgi.py
-------------------------

Run this as wsgi.  It needs a facebook app created for it and you need an offline access
token with scope as 'offline_access,read_stream' and your userid.  Then you can have urls
as:
